        <h1 class="chapter-heading" id="ii">Merc&auml; Research</h1>
        <p>The overarching cultural narrative seems to be one of individual choice. A perspective that stems from Enlightenment thinking, it puts the blame on the shopper and tells them that they need to change their ways to make the world more sustainable. Yet, this flawed way of thinking fails to realize that there aren't any convientient options currently in the market to enable shoppers to change. Moreover, most <em>&lsquo;sustainable&rsquo;</em> options on the market are out of the way and problematically packaged.</p>
        <p>Through my research I found that most grocery stores and delivery services like <mark title="Based on personal 'research'. It was yummy ðŸ˜„">Skip The Dishes, Miss Fresh, Farm Boy, Whole Foods, etc.</mark> tend to be really heavy on packaging. I found that the only<em>real</em> way that you can get your groceries fresh on an accessible scale were bulk food stores like Bulk Bark; which are still fairly spread out. To me it became quite evident that convienience is a major pain point in the market for sustainable products and devices. While sustainable options are great, when shoppers have to go far out of their way to access them for a higher price they tend to take the more convienient option instead. So I though to myself, what is the laziest, most convienient way to get food? The answer: vending machines. I ended up doing a fairly deep dive into vending machines, how their used in North America and Japan, and how their underlying technology could be adapted into a smart 'farmers market'.</p>
        <p>This gets to the crux of the idea for Merc&auml;. It is a sustainable vending machine that can essentially be placed anywhere. It avoids problematic plastic packaging by using a combination of cameras and weight sensors to dispense product into customers' reusable containers without spilling everywhere. Oh and did I mention, the food is also <em>yummy</em>. <u>It falls under two of the assigned categories: retail &amp; sustainability.</u></p>

        <p>It looks at how it isn't just people who are <em>lazy</em> being the cause of unsustainablity, but it is also because the majority of the population is <mark>trapped</mark> in a hodgepodge of unsustainable systems. It goes on to advocate for a systematic approach that would create a sustainable 'new normal'.</p>

        <h1 class="chapter-heading" id="iii">Marketing Materials</h1>
        <p>No smart device is complete without some good marketing. Below are some ads that are meant to get our target users to look into and (hopefully) use our vending machines. We decided to create ads in both print and digital mediums because, while the vending machine itself is a smart device, people will be interacting with it in the analog world.</p><br>
        <h4 class="section-heading">Subway Ads</h4>
        <p>Valery made the posters for the marketing material. She wanted to make a poster that captured the cheeky playfulness of the brand's style while still keeping the important zero-waste message intact.</p>

        <h1 class="chapter-heading" id="iv">Machine Prototype</h1>
        <p>With the machine prototypes that I created I tried to make designs that were familiar to our target user, but wouldn't be conflated with regular vending machines. I felt that if the device looked like a plain old vending machine it would be associated too much with junk food, and since were selling fresh food that would be undesirable.</p>
