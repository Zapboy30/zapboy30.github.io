					<h3>The current system of buying food is broken.</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>It&rsquo;s nearly impossible for people to buy food in a completely sustainable way.</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>But this isn&rsquo;t a result of laziness, it&rsquo;s a result of complicated melange of interconnected systems that trap the majority of the population.</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>The solution? Introduce a new system.</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Introduce a new normal.</h3>

					<h3>Every once in a while a revolutionary product comes around that changes everything.</h3>

					<h3>Say hello to Merc&auml;, our smart vending machine for the future.</h3>

					<h3>Merc&auml; combines the convienience of vending machines with the sustainability of <span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps;">byoc</span> bulk food stores.</h3>

					<h3>The problem with sustainable bulk food stores is that they are inconvienient.</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Zero waste bulk food stores are few and far between and regular bulk food stores encourage the use of single use packaging.</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Grocery stores are even worse, they're more convienient but have bad packaging practices.</h3>

					<h3>And don&rsquo;t even get me started on the current state of vending machines.</h3>

					<h3>&ldquo;Every year, Canadians throw away over 3 million tonnes of plastic waste. This represents up to $8 billion per year in lost value and wastes valuable resources and energy.&rdquo;<br> <a href="https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2019/06/10/canada-ban-harmful-single-use-plastics-and-hold-companies-responsible">&ndash;<span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps;">office of the prime minister</span></a></h3>

				<section>
					<h3>So how does Merc&auml; solve this?</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Our smart vending machine combines a combination of preexisting technologies and ideas into a sustainble and ultraconvienient food purchasing experience.</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Say goodbye to forced plastic bags, blister packs, and containers. With Merc&auml; you have to bring your own.</h3>
