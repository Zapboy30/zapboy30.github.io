      <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">A font to remember</h2>
      <p>Michelle is a font is designed in the tradition of beautiful oldstyle typefaces. I took a lot of inspiration in the making of the typeface from old literary works from the turn of the twentieth-century. The primary goal of this project was to create an oldstyle font that enabled comfortable long form reading on the web. I took stylistic queues from the calligraphic strokes of oldstyle typography and added a contemporary flair. The result was a font that is -- in my opinion -- a reflection of the atemporality of our current period in design history. </p>

      <p style="font-variation-settings: 'opsz' 100 !important;">I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion.</p>

      <p style="-moz-column-count: 2; -webkit-column-count: 2; column-count: 2;">Michelle was made to serve all of the typographic needs of small personal internet blogs. The project was completed to fulfill the course requirements of the typeface design course at Sheridan college. Although the project is technically finished, I may or may not revisit the typeface again later on when I am more skillful at type design.</p>
